      \item Translate into smooth English: $\forall x\forall y((Px \land Ty \land Dxy \land Oxy) \to \neg \exists z(Pz \land Kzxy))$.\\
            Let “Px” mean “x is a person”, “Tx” mean “x is a time”, “Dxy” mean “x is down at time y”, “Oxy” mean “x is out at time y”, and “Kxyz” mean “x knows y at time z”.\\
            Every pair of individuals x and y is such that if x is a person, y is a time, x is down at time y, and x is out at time y, then there is no z such that if z is a person, z knows x at time y. More English-y: If someone is down and out, they cannot be known by someone else at that time. Even more English-y: Nobody knows you when you're down and out.

      For problems 2-15: \textit{Write a sentence in quantificational logic that captures as much of the given information as possible. Remember to delineate the extensions you assign to names and predicates.}
