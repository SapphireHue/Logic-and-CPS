    \textbf{The Theoretical Basis for RSA Encryption}\\
    The RSA algorithm involves 5 numbers: $p, q, E, D,$ and $M$. As a brief introduction, they are:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item two different prime numbers, $p$ and $q$
        \item two numbers in $\mathbb{Z}_{(p-1)(q-1)}$:
              \begin{itemize}
                  \item the "encoding number", $E$, which is relatively prime to $(p-1)(q-1)$
                  \item the "decoding number", $D$, which is the multiplicative inverse of $E$ in $\mathbb{Z}_{(p-1)(q-1)}$
              \end{itemize}
        \item a number in $\mathbb{Z}_pq$ known as the "message number", $M$
    \end{itemize}
\end{flushleft}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Do the activity \href{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vwZHtPWf8RX4x7-8a8qORGgtC9CZb5UV/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=103144376998261263253&rtpof=true&sd=true}{Modular Inverses}\\
          $E$ must be relatively prime to $(p-1)(q-1)$ in order to have a multiplicative inverse in the system.
    \item Let $p=3$ and $q=5$. Then $(p-1)(q-1) = 8$ and $pq = 15$. Suppose that we choose $E$ to be 3. (We could choose any number that didn’t have a factor of 2 since 2 is the only factor in 8). Find $D$.\\
          $D$ is the multiplicative inverse of $E$ in $\mathbb{Z}_{8}$. Thus, $D = 3$.
    \item Sticking with the same $p, q,$ and $E$ (and therefore the same $D$), complete the table below using the rules of $\mathbb{Z}_{15}$. What do you notice about the entries of the last row?\\

          From the activity, it seems that raising a number to a power, then raising that to the multiplicative inverse of the previous power, produces the original number.

    \textbf{Theorem 5.1 (RSA Cryptosystem Crux):} Suppose that $p$ and $q$ are two distinct prime numbers. Let $E$ be relatively prime to $(p-1)(q-1)$. Then if $D$ is the multiplicative inverse of $E$ in $\mathbb{Z}_{(p-1)(q-1)}$ and if $M$ is any number in $\mathbb{Z}_{pq}$, it will always be that $M^{ED} \equiv M \mod{pq}$.\\

    \textbf{Theorem 5.2:} If $p$ and $q$ are distinct prime numbers and $M$ is a positive integer with $\gcd(M, pq) = 1$, then $M^{(p-1)(q-1)} \equiv 1 \mod{pq}$.\\

    \textbf{Theorem 5.3:} Let $p$ and $q$ be distinct prime numbers, $k$ be a positive integer, and $M$ be a number in $\mathbb{Z}_{pq}$ with $\gcd(M, pq) = 1$. Then $M^{1+k(p-1)(q-1)} \equiv M \mod{pq}$.\\

    \textbf{Theorem 5.4:} Let $p$ and $q$ be distinct primes and $E$ be a number in $\mathbb{Z}_{(p-1)(q-1)}$ such that $E$ is relatively prime to $(p-1)(q-1)$. Then $E$ has a multiplicative inverse in $\mathbb{Z}_{(p-1)(q-1)}$. That is, there exists some $D$ in $\mathbb{Z}_{(p-1)(q-1)}$ such that $D \equiv E^{-1} \mod{(p-1)(q-1)}$.
\end{flushleft}
\begin{enumerate}
    \setcounter{enumi}{4}
    \item Find the primes $p$ and $q$ if $pq = 14,647$ and $\phi(pq) = 14,400$.
          $p$ and $q$ must be distinct, since $pq$ is not a square. Thus, $\phi(pq) = (p-1)(q-1) = pq - p - q + 1 = 14,400$. Thus, we can make a system of equations to solve for $p$ and $q$:\\
          $\left\{
              \begin{array}{lcr}
                  pq             & = & 14,647 \\
                  pq - p - q + 1 & = & 14,400
              \end{array}
              \right.$\\
          Thus, $p + q - 1 = 247$, so $p + q = 248$, so $ p = 248 - q$. We can plug this back into the first equation, so $(248-q)q = 14,647 \to 248q - q^{2} = 14,647 \to 0 = q^{2} - 248q + 14,647$. I put this into the quadratic equation to get $q = 97 \text{ or } 151$. $p$ and $q$ are interchangeable in this equation, so either $p = 151, q = 97$, or $p = 97, q = 151$.
    \item Prove Theorem 5.2 based on what you have already learned (perhaps in a previous section).\\
          Let $p$ and $q$ be distinct prime numbers, and let $M$ be a positive integer with $\gcd(M, pq) = 1$. According to Euler's Theorem, if $m$ is a positive integer and $a$ is a positive integer with $\gcd(a, m) = 1$, then $a^{\phi(m)} \equiv 1 \mod{m}$. By setting $a = M$ and $m = pq$, we get $M^{\phi(pq)} \equiv 1 \mod{pq}$. In the previous section, we also determined that where $p$ and $q$ are distinct primes, $\phi(pq) = (p-1)(q-1)$. Thus, $M^{(p-1)(q-1)} \equiv 1 \mod{pq}$.
    \item Prove Theorem 5.3 based on what you have already learned.\\
          Let $p$ and $q$ be distinct prime numbers, $k$ be a positive integer, and $M$ be a number in $\mathbb{Z}_{pq}$ with $\gcd(M, pq) = 1$. $M^{1+k(p-1)(q-1)} = M \times M^{k(p-1)(q-1)} = M \times (M^{(p-1)(q-1)})^{k} \mod{pq}$. By theorem 5.2, $M^{(p-1)(q-1)} \equiv 1 \mod{pq}$, so $M \times (M^{(p-1)(q-1)})^{k} \equiv M \times 1^{k} \equiv M \mod{pq}$. Thus, $M^{1+k(p-1)(q-1)} \equiv M \mod{pq}$.
    \item Prove Theorem 5.1 (RSA Cryptosystem Crux) based on what you have already learned.\\
          Let $p$ and $q$ be two distinct prime numbers, and let $E$ be relatively prime to $(p-1)(q-1)$. By theorem 5.4, there exists a number $D$ that is the multiplicative inverse of $E$ modulo $(p-1)(q-1)$. This means $ED \equiv 1 \mod{(p-1)(q-1)}$, or $ED = k(p-1)(q-1) + 1$ for some integer $k$. Thus, $M^{ED} = M^{k(p-1)(q-1) + 1} \equiv M \mod{pq}$ by theorem 5.3. Thus, $M^{ED} \equiv M \mod{pq}$.

\textbf{The RSA Encryption Algorithm}\\ 
Suppose Alice wants to send Bob a secret message.\\
Bob picks two prime numbers, $p$ and $q$. Bob also picks an encoding number, $E$, from $Z_{(p-1)(q-1)}$ that is relatively prime to $(p-1)(q-1)$. Bob then makes $pq$ and $E$ public.\\
Alice converts her number to a message $M$ ($M$ must be less than $pq$, but this can be achieved by breaking the message into segments). To encode this message, she calculates $M^{E} \mod{pq}$. \vspace{8pt}\\ 
For these problems, suppose Bob picks $p = 3, q = 97$. Thus, $pq = 291$ and $(p-1)(q-1) = 192$. He also chooses $E = 5$.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Suppose Alice's message is the number $M = 2$. What number does she send Bob? Describe in your own words how you found this number.\\
    First, I calculated $M^{E}$. $2^{5} = 32$. $32 \mod{291} = 32$, so she will send Bob $32$.
    \item Suppose that Alice’s secret message is the number M = 150. What number does she send Bob?\\
    Again, Alice will send Bob $M^{E} \mod{pq}$, so $150^{5} \mod 291$. By modular multiplication rules, $150^{5} \mod{291} = (150^{2})^{2}*150 = 22500^{2} * 150 = (291*77 + 93)^{2} * 150 \equiv 93^2 * 150 = 8649 * 150 \equiv 210 * 150 = 31500 \equiv 72 \mod{291}$. Alice sends $72$ to Bob.
\end{enumerate}
To decode the message, Bob must find $D$, the multiplicative inverse of $E$ in $\mathbb{Z}_{(p-1)(q-1)}$. A computer can easily compute modular inverses with the Euclidean algorithm; in this case $D=77$.
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
    \item Bob can now decode Alice's message.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Verify that 77 is indeed the multiplicative inverse of 5 in $\mathbb{Z}_{192}$. Explain in your own words how you know that you are correct.\\
        To verify, I will find $77 * 5 \mod{192}$. $77*5 = 385 = 192*2 + 1$, so $77 * 5 \equiv 1 \mod{192}$, so $5^{-1} \mod{192}$ is indeed 77.
        \item Using the RSA Cryptosystem Crux Theorem, explain how Bob can use the number $D$ to decode Alice’s encoded message $M^E$ and recover her original message $M$.\\
        By the Crux Theorem, $M^{ED} = M \mod{pq}$. The encoded message Bob receives from Alice is $M^{E}$. To find $M$ and decode the message, Bob should calculate $(M^{E})^{D} \mod{pq}$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate} \hrule \vspace{8pt}   
\textbf{Why RSA Encryption is Useful}
\begin{enumerate} 
    \item Suppose that you are listening in on Bob's public transmission and you hear that $pq = 21$ and $E = 5$. Recover $(p - 1)(q - 1)$ and $D$. You have broken Bob's code!\\
    $pq = 21$, where both $p$ and $q$ are prime. Either $p = 1, q = 21$ (which would be stupid), or $p = 3, q = 7$. Thus, $(p-1)(q-1) = 2 \times 6 = 12$. $D = E^{-1} \mod{12}$, so $D = 5^{-1} \mod{12} = 5$. Thus, $(p-1)(q-1) = 12, D = 5$.
    \item You are a secret agent. An evil spy with shallow number theory skills uses the RSA Public Key Coding System in which the public modulus is $n = 1537$, and the encoding exponent is $E = 47$. You intercept one of the encoded secret messages being sent to the evil spy, namely the number 570. Using your superior number theory skills, decode this message, thereby saving countless people from the fiendish plot of the evil spy.\\
    By brute-force testing increasing prime numbers, $p = 29, q = 53$. Thus, $(p-1)(q-1) = 28 \times 52 = 1456$. $D = 31$. $M = M^{ED} \mod{pq} = 570^{D} \mod{pq}= 570^{31} \mod{1537} = (570^3)^{10} \times 570 = (120490\cdot1537 - 130)^{10} \times 570 \equiv (-130)^{10} \times 570 = ((-130)^2)^{5} \times 570 \equiv (-7)^{5} \times 570 = -16807 \times 570 \equiv 100 \times 570 = 57000 \equiv 131 \mod{1537}$.
\end{enumerate}
These codes are easy to break because the chosen values of $pq$ are relatively small. In practice, $pq$s are hundreds of digits long, making them effectively impossible to factor, even for a computer (though choosing numbers too large can make encoding and decoding difficult).\\
This is a public key encryption algorithm: Bob can make the encoding key, $E$, available to anyone, but only he has the decoding key $D$.
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
    \item Summarize RSA encryption and the advantages it offers in your own words.\\
    In RSA encryption, a person publicly releases an encrypting key and a modulus. Anyone sending them a message uses those two things to encrypt the message, but only the original person has the decrypting key. This allows messages to be encrypted and decrypted without ever needing to transmit a decoding key, eliminating the possibility of interception.
    \item Can you see any weaknesses in RSA? There are a couple and one has to make a few simple modifications to the messages being sent and the algorithm to avoid them. For the sake of simplicity, the method discussed here is the simplest version and in practice more sophisticated methods (based on the same idea) are used.\\
    When implemented correctly, RSA encryption has no weaknesses, barring quantum computers, because being able to efficiently factor large numbers allows for breaking the encryption.\\
    However, due to a couple of mathematical quirks, the following properties should be ensured:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $p$ and $q$ are both sufficiently large, to ensure a sufficiently large $pq$
        \item $p-1$ and $q-1$ each have at least one prime factor that is sufficiently large
        \item $E$ and $D$ are sufficiently large
    \end{itemize}
    Other weaknesses of RSA come from its implementation, not the mathematical principles.
\end{enumerate}
