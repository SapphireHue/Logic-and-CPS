    "Let's take a closer look at the reversibility of numbers with an odd number of digits. The center digit will always be added to itself, producing an even number. However, you can still have a 3-digit reversible number ($409$ is the example given in the problem) by being careful about the \"carry\" of an adjacent addition.\n",

    "However, a three digit number $n$ can be reversible if certain conditions are met. I'll label the digits $\\underline{n_{-1}}\\ \\underline{n_{0}}\\ \\underline{n_{1}}$, where $n_{1}$ is the ones place and $n_{-1}$ is the hundreds. I'll label the sum $n$ + reverse($n$) as $s$ and the digits of the sum $\\underline{s_{-2}}\\ \\underline{s_{-1}}\\ \\underline{s_{0}}\\ \\underline{s_{1}}$, where $s_{1}$ is the one's place and $s_{-2}$ is the (potential) thousands place. We can see $s_{1} = n_{1} + n_{-1}$, $s_{0} = n{0} + n{0}$, and $s_{-1} = n_{-1} + n_{1}$, although each digit may need 1 added to it (a carry) if the digit to the right was greater than 10. We can generalize this as \n",

    "\\right.$. $n_{0} + n_{0}$ will always be even, so for $s_{0}$ to be odd, a carry must be added to it. Thus, $s_{1}$ must be greater than 10 (i.e. $n_{1} + n_{-1}$ must produce a carry). Because $n_{1} + n_{-1}$ produced a carry, $n_{-1} + n_{1}$ must as well, so $s_{-1} > 10$, so $s_{-2} = 1$. Thus, every reversible 3 digit number must have the first digit and last digit sum to an odd number greater than 10.\n",

    "However, this doesn't work for five digits. Let there be a five digit reversible number $n$, with digits $\\underline{n_{-2}}\\ \\underline{n_{-1}}\\ \\underline{n_{0}}\\ \\underline{n_{1}}\\ \\underline{n_{2}}$. The same logic as above holds for digits -1 through 1. Because we determined that $s_{-1} > 10$ and there would be a carry on $s_{-2}$, we now know $n_{-2} + n_{2}$ must be even for $s_{-2}$ to be odd. However, this violates one of the first principles we discovered about reversible numbers: that the first and last digits must sum to an odd number (in this case, so that $s_{2}$ can be odd). Thus, there cannot exist a five digit reversible number.\n",
