      \item Knaves always lie, knights always tell the truth, and in Transylvania, where everybody is one or the other (but you can't tell which by looking), you encounter two people, one of whom says, “He's a knight or I'm a knave.” What are they? (J 20)\\\\
            A: I'm a knight.\\
            B: He's a knight.\\
            C: He's a knight or I'm a knave.\\
            Notes:\\
            If being a knight is false, being a knave is true.\\
            If I am a knight, then (he's a knight or I'm not a knight). If I'm not a knight, then not (he's a knight or I'm not a knight).\\
            To solve the problem, we must find a combination of knight and knave such that the truth value of “he's a knight or I'm a knave” is consistent with whether or not I'm a knight. Therefore, we're searching for a value where C and A are equivalent.\\

      \item \textit{Write the argument in standard form.}
      \item \textit{Claim whether the argument is valid or sound. In some cases, soundness will be difficult to determine, so “soundness is difficult to determine” is an appropriate answer.}
      \item \textit{Translate the argument into truth-functional logic. Be sure to delineate the extensions you give to atomic sentences and write the argument (now in truth-functional logic) in standard form.}
      \item \textit{Prove that the argument is valid or invalid (as appropriate) with a proof by truth table.}
      \item \textit{Prove that the argument is valid or invalid (as appropriate) with an informal proof.}

                        Where both premises are true, B can still be either true or false. This means there is no guarantee the patient will not die, so the argument is invalid.

On one hand, if you're right you're a fool and if you're a fool you're not right doesn't seem to work, but it is possible to be a fool and not right without violating either premise. So it is possible for them to both be true at the same time, I think? Just very strange.\\

      \item Consider the tic-tac-toe grid with the squares labeled as this:
            \begin{center}
                  \begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
                        1 & 2 & 3 \\
                        \hline
                        4 & 5 & 6 \\
                        \hline
                        7 & 8 & 9
                  \end{tabular}
            \end{center}
            Suppose that X moves first to square 5, and O moves next to square 4. Prove that X can
            guarantee a win. (Cline)\\\\
            X's next move should be to square 1.
            After these three moves, the board looks like this:
            \begin{center}
                  \begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
                        X & 2 & 3 \\
                        \hline
                        O & X & 6 \\
                        \hline
                        7 & 8 & 9
                  \end{tabular}
            \end{center}
            At this point, if O chooses to move to any square other than square 9, X can move to square 9 on the next turn and win. See below for one possible outcome:
            \begin{center}
                  \begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
                        X & O & 3 \\
                        \hline
                        O & X & 6 \\
                        \hline
                        7 & 8 & X
                  \end{tabular}
            \end{center}
            If O \textit{does} chose to move to square 9, X can move next to square 3. The board would then look like this:
            \begin{center}
                  \begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
                        X & 2 & X \\
                        \hline
                        O & X & 6 \\
                        \hline
                        7 & 8 & O
                  \end{tabular}
            \end{center}
            If O played in any square other than 2, X could play in square 2 on the next turn and win. However, the same is true of square 7: if O plays in any square other than 7, X can then play in square 7 and win.
            However, O cannot play in both squares 2 and 7 on the same turn. Regardless of where O plays, X will be able to win by playing in either square 2 or square 7.
      \item You can't make a valid argument invalid by adding premises. (J 19)\\
            This claim is correct. An argument is invalid if and only if there is a counterexample, i.e. a case where all premises are true but the conclusion is false. Adding a premise can never cause a case where not all premises were true to become a case with all true premises. Thus, adding a premise can never increase the number of counterexamples an argument has. Because valid arguments have no counterexamples, adding a premise to a valid argument will keep the argument's state as having no counterexamples. Thus, the argument will still be valid.
      \item You can't make an invalid argument valid by removing premises. (J 19)\\
            This claim is correct. An argument is invalid if and only if it has one or more counterexample. Removing premises from an argument cannot cause a case to go from having all true premises to having at least one untrue premise. Thus, removing premises can only create new counterexamples, not remove counterexamples. Therefore, removing premises from an argument with at least one counterexample can never cause the argument to have no counterexamples, so removing premises from an invalid argument can never create a valid argument.
      \item Suppose ($A \land B) \to C$ is contingent. What can you say about the argument \begin{tabular}{c}A\\B\\\hline C\end{tabular}? (M 46)\\
            \textit{Saffron's Commentary: I don't really know what contingent means! It's defined in the textbook, but I don't know if this question means “C is contingent upon $A \land B$” or simply “$(A \land B) \to C$” may be true or untrue depending on the case. I'm assuming the latter for this problem, but who knows.
                  Update: it's fine, probably? See theorem-argument exchange (Theorem 1.1).}\\
            The argument is invalid. For ($A \land B) \to C$ to be contingent (and not a tautology), there must be at least one case where the conditional is false. This means there is a case where $A \land B$ is true but C is false, which would be a counterexample to the argument, rendering it invalid.
      \item Suppose the argument \begin{tabular}{c}A\\B\\\hline C\end{tabular} is valid. What can you say about ($A \land B) \to C$?\\
            ($A \land B) \to C$ is a tautology. Because the argument is valid, there is no case where all premises (both A and B) are true but C is false. Such a case would be the only one in which the conditional was not true, but because it does not exist, ($A \land B) \to C$ must always be true.
      \item Some arguments with contradictory premises aren't valid. (B 59)\\
            This claim is incorrect. For an argument to be valid, there must be a counterexample. However, if the premises are contradictory, there is no case where all premises are true, and thus no counterexamples.
      \item Suppose that \{A, B, C\} is inconsistent. What can you say about $A \land B \land C$? (M 46)\\
            $A \land B \land C$ is always false and therefore a contradiction. Because \{A, B, C\} is inconsistent, there is no case in which they are all true, so there must always be at least one atomic sentence which is false. $A \land B \land C$ is false if at least one of it's atomic sentences is false.
      \item Some arguments whose conclusions are contradictions are valid.\\
            This claim is true. Any argument with inconsistent premises will never have a counterexample, because there is no case where all premises are true. Thus, the argument would be valid.
